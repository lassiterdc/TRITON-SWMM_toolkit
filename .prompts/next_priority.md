# What Should I Do Next?

Identify the next highest-priority task based on `priorities.md` and planning documents.

## Decision Criteria

1. **Tier ordering** — prefer current tier before moving to next
2. **Blockers** — skip items blocked by upstream or other work
3. **Dependencies** — Tier 2 should finish before Tier 3
4. **Momentum** — continue current phase if partially complete

## Analysis Steps

1. Check `priorities.md` for next unchecked `[ ]` item in current tier
2. Verify no blockers are listed
3. Check if any prep work or planning documents exist
4. Confirm all prerequisites are met

## Expected Output

Clear recommendation with:
- Task name and tier
- Reference to planning document (if exists)
- Brief justification for why this is next
- Any prep work needed before starting
